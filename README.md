# N-queens & Lexicographical Permutations

This was an exercise in using recursion to solve the n-queens puzzle. My approach was to:

1. Implement a lexicographical permutation algorithm to produce the possible locations of queens on an n x n board.

3. Iterate through these permutations to identify solutions to the puzzle.

This also includes the ability to:

- Produce all of the lexicographical permutations for a given set of characters.
- Determine the minimum number of coins (and denomination) for a given dollar/cent amount.
